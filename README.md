###OpenContainer
##Lightweight, rootless “containers” for ANY device
#A drop-in, Docker-compatible orchestration engine built on PRoot. Run full multi-service stacks (PostgreSQL, Node.js, Redis, Supabase, and more) on unrooted Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows (via WSL/QEMU), and other constrained environments.
###🚀 Project Overview
OpenContainer is an open-source, cross-platform containerization system that lets you:
 * Pull & run real Docker images (Alpine, Ubuntu, Postgres, Node, etc.)
 * Compose multi-service stacks via docker-compose.yml-style files
 * Isolate each service in its own PRoot-based rootfs (no kernel namespaces or cgroups needed)
 * Expose ports & mount volumes just like Docker, on localhost
 * Stay entirely unprivileged—no root, no VM, no kernel modules
🎯 Motivation
 * No Root, No VMs
   Android devices with broken UIs, iOS sandboxes, school computers, WSL… all can run full container stacks without hacking the kernel or paying the VM penalty.
 * Docker Compatibility
   Leverage the vast Docker Hub ecosystem. Pull official images, parse their layers, honor ENTRYPOINT/CMD/ENV, and wire them together via Compose.
 * Lightweight & Portable
   Skip dockerd, containerd, runc, systemd, and all that bloat. Your total footprint is a single lightweight binary (Rust/C++) plus a handful of rootfs folders.
✨ Key Features
 * OCI Image Support
   * Pull from Docker Hub or private registries
   * Unpack layers, apply whiteouts, reconstruct rootfs
   * Read Config (CMD, Entrypoint, Env, Volumes)
 * Compose Orchestration
   * Parse docker-compose.yml (services, ports, volumes, networks, dependencies)
   * Auto-generate PRoot startup scripts (run.sh) for each service
   * Single command: opencontainer up, opencontainer down, opencontainer ps, opencontainer logs
 * PRoot Isolation
   * Per-service proot -R ./rootfs with bind mounts, cwd, user-0 emulation
   * Shared network via localhost port mapping
   * Volume support via -b /host/path:/container/path
 * Cross-Platform
   * Android (Termux, UserLAnd), iOS (iSH-style/WASM), Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL/QEMU)
   * Single codebase in Rust (or C++)—compile to native or to WASM for special targets
 * Extensible CLI
   * Plugin-friendly: custom commands, hooks, healthchecks
   * TUI dashboard (future)

 * Compose Parser
   Uses serde_yaml to translate your Compose file into an in-memory model.
 * Image Manager
   Pulls & caches images; unpacks layers in correct order, applies metadata.
 * Orchestrator & Runner
   Walks the dependency graph (depends_on), allocates ports, writes run.sh scripts invoking proot.
 * Controller
   Implements Docker-style commands (up, down, ps, logs) by launching/stopping those scripts and tailing logs.
🛠️ Getting Started
# Clone & build
git clone https://github.com/AIRAS-The-Innovations-Of-New-Era/OpenContainer.git

cd OpenContainer
cargo build --release            # or cmake/make for C++

# Install the binary
cp target/release/opencontainer /usr/local/bin/

# Prepare a compose file
cat > docker-compose.yml <<EOF
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=example
    volumes:
      - dbdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  api:
    image: node:18-alpine
    command: "npm start"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

volumes:
  dbdata:
